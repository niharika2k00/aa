1. GROUP BY to create groups
2. Apply the AGGREGATE FUNCTION  (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG())
3. Apply HAVING condition.

         * HAVING vs WHERE
         * WHERE is applied on individual rows while HAVING is applied on groups.
         * HAVING is applied after grouping while WHERE is used before grouping.
